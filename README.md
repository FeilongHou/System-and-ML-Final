## Introduction

Welcome to our final project for the System and Machine Learning course. In this project, we present a comparative study of Analog Matrix Processors (AMPs) and their speed and efficiency when compared to Digital Processors. We investigate the potential advantages and trade-offs in using AMPs for various computational tasks.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, we have:

- Conducted a thorough literature review on Analog Matrix Processors and Digital Processors.
- Implemented a range of experiments to evaluate the performance of Analog Matrix Processors.
- Collected and analyzed data to compare the speed and efficiency of AMPs against Digital Processors.
- Presented our findings, insights, and conclusions in a comprehensive report.
